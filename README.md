# QuickAddressBook

This code is from a tutorial on how to use the Qt framework with Visual Studio, this time using Qt Quick. It creates a very simple e-mail adress book, and it can be found here:
https://doc.qt.io/qtvstools/qtvstools-qt-quick-application.html

I followed this tutorial for my own practice, as I plan to use the Qt framework in a future personal project. 
An interesting experience, as problems and the lack of clarity in the tutorial forced me to study QML further. Feel free to contact me if you attempt to reproduce the tutorial for yourself and find problems.
